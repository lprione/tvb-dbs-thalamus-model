# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks used during development (exploration, plotting, sensitivity analysis).

## Important

- Notebook outputs are intentionally **cleared** before committing to keep the repository lightweight.
- If you re-run a notebook, export figures to `../figures/` and store large arrays on disk (not inside the notebook).

## Contents

- `Jansen-Rit-76.ipynb`  
  Notes/experiments related to the Jansen–Rit neural mass model.
- `Sensitivity Analysis.ipynb`  
  Sensitivity/sweep exploration (lightweight committed version).
