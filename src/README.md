# TVB DBS Model – Source Code Overview

This folder contains core scripts used for analyzing and visualizing simulation results from the TVB-based DBS thalamic model. It includes both EEG analysis tools and 3D brain model visualization.

## 🧪 EEG Analysis (FieldTrip)

`analyze_simulated_eeg.m` provides an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing simulated EEG signals derived from DBS models, using the [FieldTrip](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/) toolbox.

### 📋 Features

- **Artifact rejection** based on thresholding and statistical methods  
- **Epoching** of data around DBS stimulation events  
- **ERP (Event-Related Potentials)** and **GMFP (Global Mean Field Power)** computation  
- **Topographical plotting** of neural activity across electrodes and time  

### 🛠 Requirements

- MATLAB  
- [FieldTrip Toolbox](https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/)  
- EEG simulation output from your TVB/DBS model  

> 💡 A similar analysis was performed on real EEG data using a private version of the pipeline adapted from `analyze_simulated_eeg.m`. Due to ownership and collaboration considerations, that code is not publicly available.

## 🧠 TVB Head Model Visualization

`plot_tvb_headmodel.m` provides a 3D visualization of a head model based on structural data from *The Virtual Brain* (TVB). It is mainly used to validate and illustrate brain region positioning and mesh structure.

### 📋 Features

- Loads surface meshes of cortex and scalp  
- Plots regional centers derived from a 76-node connectivity matrix  
- Highlights custom-defined regions (e.g., amygdala)  
- Supports figure export for documentation or presentations  

### 📁 Required Input Files

- `cortex/vertices.txt`, `cortex/triangles.txt`  
- `face/vertices.txt`, `face/triangles.txt`  
- `centers.txt` — XYZ coordinates of TVB-defined brain regions  

> These files were exported using the TVB GUI with a connectivity setup of **76 brain regions**.

### 🖼 Output

- A 3D figure of the head model with mesh surfaces and highlighted region centers  
- Optional export to `tvb_headmodel.png`

### 🔧 How to Use

Open the script in MATLAB and run:

```matlab
plot_tvb_headmodel
```

Ensure input files are located in their expected folders.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Both scripts are designed to be modular and adaptable to custom models.  
- You may modify node selections or plotting styles depending on your region of interest.  
- Scripts are well-suited for integration into broader pipelines for TVB or neurostimulation modeling.

## ⚡ DBS_func – Custom Temporal Stimulation for TVB

`dbs_func.py` is a fully custom stimulation pattern class designed to work with The Virtual Brain (TVB) simulator. It models a biphasic pulse train followed by an exponential decay, providing a biologically inspired stimulation pattern for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) modeling studies.

### 🧠 Overview

The function extends TVB’s `TemporalApplicableEquation` interface and can be used as a temporal input for `StimuliRegion` objects in simulations. It supports configuration of pulse width, repetition frequency, onset time, and an optional exponential decay component.

---

### 🚀 Example Usage

```python
from src.dbs_func import DBS_func
import tvb.simulator.lab as tsl
import numpy as np

# Instantiate DBS temporal function
eqn_t = DBS_func()

# Create stimulation pattern
stimulus = tsl.patterns.StimuliRegion(
    temporal=eqn_t,
    connectivity=conn1,
    weight=stim_weights
)

# Configure the stimulus in time and space
stimulus.configure_space()
stimulus.configure_time(np.arange(498.75, 505.75, 0.001))

# Visualize the stimulation
tsl.plot_pattern(stimulus)
```

---

### 🧪 Applications

- Simulating realistic DBS input in brain network models  
- Comparing effects of stimulation frequencies, amplitudes, and pulse shapes  
- Investigating region-specific response to stimulation  

---

### 📌 Notes

- Can be combined with `StimuliRegion` weights to target specific regions.  
- Fully compatible with TVB models and simulation pipelines.  
- Developed by **Lorenzo Prione**.
